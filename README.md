# Hello, fellow professionals! 🚀

## About me 🧠

With a foundation in finance and a journey through roles such as Financial Analyst and Credit Administration, I understand financial processes. However, my true passion lies in refining and optimizing these processes through automation. I focus on driving efficiency, ensuring that workflows are streamlined, and minimizing errors by leveraging low-code/no-code tools, which require minimal investment to implement effectively.

I believe strongly in the power of teamwork; collaborating effectively with colleagues is essential to creating solutions that address diverse needs and drive meaningful results. Known for my problem-solving approach, I focus on finding solutions over dwelling on challenges and am constantly learning new skills to support both team and organizational goals.
